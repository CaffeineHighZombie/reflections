When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
   We would want to use remote repository rather working with just local respository when we might be working 
   from a bunch of different computers or we are collaborating on a project with other people. On top of it, 
   it also allows the implicit data redundacy on the cloud and ability share the project with public.

When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    We would want to use remote repository rather working with just local respository when we might be 
    working from a bunch of different computers or we are collaborating on a project with other people. On 
    top of it, it also allows the implicit data redundacy on the cloud and ability share the project with 
    public.
   
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    As with commit and push, having to manually pull changes allows us a degree of freedom as to if and 
    when we would like to include the changes from the remote repository. Also, with the ability to context 
    switch with local branches we can incoporate and test changes locally in different branch other than 
    master and then, merge them according to our wish.
